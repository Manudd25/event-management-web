# event-management-web

This React app displays a list of meetups, allows users to mark meetups as favorites, and uses React Context and localStorage to persist these favorites. It includes routing for navigation between pages (All Meetups, Favorites, and New Meetup) using React Router. The FavoritesContext manages the favorites state globally, allowing users to toggle favorites and keep their selections across sessions. Each component is styled with CSS Modules, ensuring scoped and reusable styles.
